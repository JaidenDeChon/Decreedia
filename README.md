This project finds unbiased and uncensored news headlines from trusted sources. 

One idea very close to my heart is probably one you can relate to-- people should have easy access to the important news of today's rapidly changing world. 

I got tired of going to huge news outlets and being bombarded with the latest Kardashian scandal or some uneducated opinion about quarterbacks not standing before football games. 

Equally deplorable were the sites that have an obvious left or right lean when discussing sensitive and complex topics. It could be argued these sites are essentially worthless to those who want to form their own opinions about today's important current events. 



I knew there must be sites out there containing articles with worth. Sites that would report on important stories of today's goings-on, without a bias or agenda. After doing plenty of research, I found a handful of sites who not only report primarily on major topics, but also don't spin them in one way or another, and don't censor hard-to-swallow facts or, more importantly, unpopular opinions. 

Through doing this research, I also found there's no one place one could go to find all these important stories from their various sources. I was looking for almost a hub of sorts, where readers could go to see the top headlines from many reputable sources, and simply click to go to the website where it's hosted so they can read. Long story short, I couldn't find one. 

Since there's no obvious place you can go to see everything available, why not make one? 

Such a website would be beneficial to every party involved. The user goes to this "hub" to find unbiased news, gets what they're looking for, and finds some new favorite news sites in the process. The websites they visit would benefit from all these additional page views and possible new users. The owner of this "hub" benefits because they created a tool that could be of so much use to so many people. It would also make a killer entry in one's portfolio, but that's not what we're here to discuss. 

This project is my stab at taking that idea and bringing it to fruition. Thanks for reading.
